A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for investigation of anemia and multiple liver tumors. Examinations revealed ascending colon carcinoma with more than 40 liver metastases and 2 lung metastases. We performed right hemicolectomy with lymph node dissection, which was followed by 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, oxaliplatin, plus bevacizumab (FOLFOX-BV). After 4 courses of chemotherapy, the lung metastases were in complete remission and the liver metastases had shrunk. We suggested the option of radical liver resection, but the patient declined initially as he had not suffered any severe side effects of FOLFOX-BV. After 23 courses of the chemotherapy, he agreed to undergo hepatectomy. We performed extended right lobectomy with partial left and caudal lobe resection. All of the macroscopic metastatic lesions were resected. Histopathologically, viable cancer cells were recognized in 7 of the 43 liver metastatic lesions. Postoperatively, FOLFOX-BV was restarted and continued for 10 months. At the time of writing, 15 months after the hepatectomy, the patient was well without evidence of recurrence of the cancer."

It is intended to be a general English lexicon that includes many biomedical terms. Coverage includes both commonly occurring English words and biomedical vocabulary. The lexicon entry for each word or term records the syntactic, morphological, and orthographic information needed by the SPECIALIST NLP System.  The Lexical Tools are designed to address the high degree of variability in natural language words and terms. Words often have several inflected forms which would properly be considered instances of the same word. The verb "treat", for example, has three inflectional variants: "treats" the third person singular present tense form, "treated" the past and past participle form, and "treating" the present participle form. Multi-word terms in the Metathesaurus and other controlled vocabularies may have word order variants in addition to their inflectional and alphabetic case variants. The Lexical Tools allow the user to abstract away from this sort of variation."

While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown.  Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some children develop spine deformities that continue to get more severe as they grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly.  Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children will need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to keep the scoliosis from worsening and to straighten severe cases of scoliosis."

Cessation of physical activity usually results in immediate improvement of symptoms. (See Clinical Presentation.)

In utero rubella is a known cause of autism. Animal model data support the biologic plausibility that exposure to yet unrecognized infectious or other environmental agents could cause ASD. Several factors may contribute to apparent increases in incidence of ASD in recent years. Most data indicate increased recognition and reporting as primary factors, but the epidemiologic data are insufficient to determine if there has been a true increase in the incidence of ASD. Increased reporting of ASD in recent years has occurred long after the introduction of MMR vaccine in the United States in 1971 and widespread use of this vaccine in the 1970s for routine immunization of children at 12 to 15 months of age. Appropriate detailed studies are needed to define the true incidence and prevalence of ASD. Epidemiologic studies in Europe indicate no association between MMR vaccine and ASD. Some children with ASD have gastrointestinal symptoms, but an increased rate of any specific gastrointestinal disorder in children with ASD has not been established. Studies to detect evidence of measles virus in gut tissue sample from patients with IBD or autism with gastrointestinal symptoms have not used uniform techniques. Several laboratories have found no evidence of measles viruses in tissue specimens from patients with IBD, but 2 groups have found evidence of measles virus using different techniques. A group that found evidence of measles virus in affected tissue specimens from patients with IBD has also reported detecting portions of measles virus in peripheral blood lymphocytes and intestinal tissue specimens from patients with autism and gastrointestinal disorders. Finding a portion of a virus using molecular techniques does not constitute evidence for a causal relationship, because some viruses persist in unaffected hosts. Additional controlled studies in several laboratories are needed to determine if portions of measles virus persist in intestinal and other tissues of people with and without gastrointestinal disease and/or ASD."

He had bilateral interstitial opacities on chest radiography and was empirically treated for bacterial pneumonia. His condition deteriorated, and he was intubated for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse consolidative opacities (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Laboratory studies were notable for negative HIV testing and a markedly elevated level of C-reactive protein (30.7 mg per deciliter) (Table 1). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid showed neutrophilic predominance (49%) and more than 50% lipid-laden macrophages by oil red O staining. Testing of this fluid by culture and polymerase-chain-reaction assay for bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens did not reveal any evidence of infection. Methylprednisolone (1 mg per kilogram of body weight) was administered, but refractory hypoxemia developed, and the patient was treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). During the next 7 days, his condition improved, with resolution of radiographic opacities, and he was extubated and weaned from ECMO. He was discharged home without supplemental oxygen 2 weeks after initial presentation.  These cases are similar to those reported by Layden et al.,1 with diffuse pulmonary opacities, systemic symptoms, and elevated levels of inflammatory markers (Table 1; also see the Supplementary Appendix). A notable and consistent feature of the cases we report is the presence of lipid-laden macrophages seen with oil red O staining in BAL samples that are not attributable to aspiration of exogenous lipoid material. In addition, the diffuse parenchymal opacities seen on CT scans did not have low attenuation (in Hounsfield units) consistent with classic lipoid pneumonia.2 Although the pathophysiological significance of these lipid-laden macrophages and their relation to the cause of this syndrome are not yet known, we posit that they may be a useful marker of this disease.3-5 Further work is needed to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of lipid-laden macrophages for vaping-related lung injury, and at this stage they cannot be used to confirm or exclude this syndrome. However, when vaping-related lung injury is suspected and infectious causes have been excluded, the presence of lipid-laden macrophages in BAL fluid may suggest v"

Goma, which has a population of one million people, is on the border with Rwanda and has a major international airport.  Prof Bausch said: "The J&J vaccine is not ideally suited to an outbreak setting, primarily because it requires two doses to provide the optimal immunity."  But he said the vaccine "may provide longer-term immunity, and may be associated with fewer side-effects than a live virus vaccine, like the Merck one".  The number of new cases in DR Congo's Ebola outbreak has dropped significantly since its height in the spring, but there are still around 20 new infections reported every week.  Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, which is helping to fund the J&J trial was a "critical step forward".  "Previous trials have shown that the J&J vaccine produces an immune response, a good indication it will be protective against the Ebola virus."  Scepticism Dr Eteni Longondo, Minister of Public Health in DR Congo, said: "It's critical that we step up our efforts. That's why we're working with international partners to provide our response teams with another tool to fight and ultimately stop the spread of this terrible disease."  The outbreak has been fuelled by misinformating people and rumors, along with an very difficult security situation.  Around 200 health facilities have been assaulted since the outbreak began in August 2018, so presenting a new vaccine into already questioning communities is a major task.  Immunization teams from the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) will distribute the vaccine.

Infections usually occur due to inhalation of the arthroconidial spores after soil disruption. The disease is not contagious. In some cases the infection may recur or become chronic. It is not unusual to see this disease in dogs.  It must rain first to start the cycle of initial growth of the fungus underneath the soil.[11] In soil (and in agar media), Coccidioides exist in filament form. It forms hyphae in both horizontal and vertical directions. Over a prolonged dry period, cells within hyphae degenerate to form alternating barrel-shaped cells (arthroconidia). Arthroconidia are light-weight and carried by air currents. This happens when the soil is disturbed often by clearing trees, construction and farming. As the population grows, so have all these industries, causing a potential cascade effect. The more land that is cleared, the more arid the soil, the riper the environment for Coccidioides.[12] These spores can be easily inhaled without the person knowing. On arriving in alveoli, they enlarge in size to become spherules, and internal septations develop. This division of cells is made possible by the optimal temperature inside the body.[13] Septations develop and form endospores within the spherule. Rupture of spherules release these endospores, which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection to adjacent tissues within the body of the infected individual. Nodules can form in lungs surrounding these spherules. When they rupture, they release their contents into bronchi, forming thin-walled cavities. These cavities can result in symptoms like characteristic chest pain, coughing up blood, and persistent cough. In individuals with a weakened immune system, the infection can spread through the blood. On rare occasion it can enter the body through a break in the skin, causing infection.[13]"

The current study replicated and extended Rooker et al. (2018) by classifying the physical characteristics of injuries across groups of individuals with automatically maintained SIB (ASIB Subtypes 2 and 3) and socially maintained SIB. Individuals with Subtype 2 ASIB had the most frequent and severe injuries. Further, an inverse relation was found between the level of differentiation in the functional analysis and the number of injuries across groups. Studying the response products of SIB (the injuries) documents the risks associated with SIB, justifies the need for research and the intensive intervention, and advances knowledge of SIB. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings, and determine the variables that produce different characteristics of injury secondary to SIB."

Some people will only experience a "faint sensation of pressure" or pain in the jaw, back, or arm, while others will only experience shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and even flu-like symptoms.    According to Narula, female patients should be especially attuned to these potential symptoms. Many women will attribute them to the gastrointestinal tract, acid reflux, stress or anxiety, before they ever consider the heart.   "I always tell women, any new chest pain that you experience needs to be evaluated," she said. "You always want to make sure it's not the heart first, before you blame another system."  Heart disease claims more lives every year than all forms of cancer combined, according to the American Heart Association. Some people are at a higher risk for heart disease through factors that are out of their control, such as age and family history. But Narula explained that about 80% of total cases are brought on by lifestyle choices, and therefore can be prevented. "

The overproduction of red blood cells is most dramatic. But the production of white blood cells and platelets are also elevated in most cases. Since red blood cells are overproduced in the marrow, this leads to abnormally high numbers of circulating red blood cells (red blood mass) within the blood. Consequently, the blood thickens and increases in volume, a condition called hyperviscosity. Thickened blood may not flow through smaller blood vessels properly. A variety of symptoms can occur in individuals with polycythemia vera including nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, weakness, dizziness or itchy skin; an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly); a variety of gastrointestinal issues; and the risk of blood clot formation, which may prevent blood flow to vital organs. More than 90 percent of individuals with polycythemia vera have a mutation of the JAK2 gene. The exact role of this mutation in the development of polycythemia vera is not yet known.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been associated with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been associated with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to the how often symptoms occur, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to the how often symptoms occur, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma.

In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to the how often symptoms occur, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally.

Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

Cirrhosis is usually caused by alcohol addiction, hepatitis B and C, and fatty liver disease, but has many other possible causes. Some cases are idiopathic (i.e., cause is not known).  Ascites (retaining fluid in the abdominal cavity) is the most common complication of cirrhosis, and is linked with a poor quality of life, increased risk of infection, and a poor long-term result. Other potentially life-threatening complications are hepatic encephalopathy (confusion and coma) and bleeding from esophageal varices. Cirrhosis is generally irreversible, and treatment usually focuses on preventing progression and complications. In advanced stages of cirrhosis the only choice is a liver transplant.  The word "cirrhosis" comes from Greek ?????? [kirrhós] meaning yellow, tawny (the orange-yellow color of the diseased liver) + Eng. med. suff. -osis. While the clinical entity was known before, it was René Laennec who gave it the name "cirrhosis" in his 1819 work in which he also describes the stethoscope.  Pathophysiology  The liver plays a critical role in forming proteins (e.g., albumin, clotting factors and complement), detoxifing and storing (e.g., vitamin A). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates.  Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is taken away at this stage, the changes are still fully reversible.  The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma, stoping the portal flow of blood through the organ and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the stellate cell, a cell type that usually stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma leads to activation of the stellate cell, which becomes contractile (called myofibroblast) and blocks blood flow in the circulation. In addition, it releases TGF-?1, which results in a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it releases TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.  The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate liver cell nodules, which eventually replace the whole liver architecture, leading to reduced blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal high blood pressure is responsible for most serious complications of cirrhosis.  Diagnosis  The gold standard for diagnosing cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data indicate cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but important risk to liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications due to liver biopsy. Ascites, low platelet count, and spider nevi are useful physical findings."

The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate liver cell nodules, which eventually replace the whole liver architecture, leading to reduced blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal high blood pressure is responsible for most serious complications of cirrhosis.  Diagnosis  The gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach.

While the clinical entity was known before, it was René Laennec who gave it the name "cirrhosis" in his 1819 work in which he also describes the stethoscope.  Pathophysiology  The liver plays a critical role in forming proteins (e.g., albumin, clotting factors and complement), detoxifying and storing (e.g., vitamin A). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates.  Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is taken away at this stage, the changes are still fully reversible.  The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma, stopping the portal flow of blood through the organ and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the stellate cell, a cell type that usually stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma leads to activation of the stellate cell, which becomes contractile (called myofibroblast) and blocks blood flow in the circulation. In addition, it releases TGF-?1, which results in a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it secretes TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.  The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate liver cell nodules, which eventually replace the whole liver architecture, leading to reduced blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal high blood pressure is responsible for most serious complications of cirrhosis.  Diagnosis  The gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data indicate cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but important risk to liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications due to liver biopsy. Ascites, low platelet count, and spider nevi are useful physical findings."

Ascites (retaining fluid in the abdominal cavity) is the most common complication of cirrhosis, and is linked with a poor quality of life, increased risk of infection, and a poor long-term result. Other potentially life-threatening complications are hepatic encephalopathy (confusion and coma) and bleeding from esophageal varices. Cirrhosis is generally irreversible, and treatment usually focuses on preventing progression and complications. In advanced stages of cirrhosis the only choice is a liver transplant.  The word "cirrhosis" comes from Greek ?????? [kirrhós] meaning yellow, tawny (the orange-yellow color of the diseased liver) + Eng. med. suff. -osis. While the clinical entity was known before, it was René Laennec who gave it the name "cirrhosis" in his 1819 work in which he also describes the stethoscope.  Pathophysiology  The liver plays a critical role in forming proteins (e.g., albumin, clotting factors and complement), detoxifying and storing (e.g., vitamin A). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates.  Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is taken away at this stage, the changes are still fully reversible.  The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma, stopping the portal flow of blood through the organ and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the stellate cell, a cell type that usually stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma leads to activation of the stellate cell, which becomes contractile (called myofibroblast) and blocks blood flow in the circulation. In addition, it releases TGF-?1, which results in a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it secretes TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.  The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate liver cell nodules, which eventually replace the whole liver architecture, leading to reduced blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal high blood pressure is responsible for most serious complications of cirrhosis.  Diagnosis  The gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data indicate cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but important risk to liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications due to liver biopsy. Ascites, low platelet count, and spider nevi are useful physical findings."

The overproduction of red blood cells is most dramatic. But the production of white blood cells and platelets are also elevated in most cases. Since red blood cells are overproduced in the marrow, this leads to abnormally high numbers of circulating red blood cells (red blood mass) within the blood. Consequently, the blood thickens and increases in volume, a condition called hyperviscosity. Thickened blood may not flow through smaller blood vessels properly. A variety of symptoms can occur in individuals with polycythemia vera including nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, weakness, dizziness or itchy skin; an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly); a variety of gastrointestinal issues; and the risk of blood clot formation, which may prevent blood flow to vital organs.

This group includes those with genetic immune diseases, immune-debilitating infections like HIV (the AIDS virus), and even pregnant women.

Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon. Alternative therapies share in common that they reside outside medical science, and rely on pseudoscience. Traditional practices become "alternative" when used outside their original settings without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Frequently used derogatory terms for the alternative are new-age or pseudo, with little distinction from quackery."
