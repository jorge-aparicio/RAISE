This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.  For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.  Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust treatment as needed."

The fungus is known to live in the soil in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico and Central and South America. The fungus was also recently found in south-central Washington. People can get Valley fever by breathing in the microscopic fungal spores from the air, although most people who breathe in the spores don’t get sick. Usually, people who get sick with Valley fever will get better on their own within weeks to months, but some people will need antifungal medication. Certain groups of people are at higher risk for becoming severely ill. It’s difficult to prevent exposure to Coccidioides in areas where it’s common in the environment, but people who are at higher risk for severe Valley fever should try to avoid breathing in large amounts of dust if they’re in these areas."

In pemphigus vulgaris, lesions also develop on the mucous membranes such as those lining the inside the mouth. Mucous membranes are the thin, moist coverings of many of the body's internal surfaces. If left untreated, pemphigus will usually be fatal. The exact cause of pemphigus is unknown.  The term pemphigus is a general term for a group of related autoimmune blistering skin diseases. The two main types of pemphigus are pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus. Each type has subtypes. Additional disorders are sometimes classified as pemphigus including paraneoplastic pemphigus and pemphigus IgA. Some physicians consider these disorders similar, yet distinct, autoimmune blistering disorders with different causes and clinical, immunological and microscopic tissue (histological) features. Pemphigoid is a general term for a different group of skin disorders. These other disorders are discussed in the related disorders section of this report."

The overproduction of red blood cells is most dramatic. But the production of white blood cells and platelets are also elevated in most cases. Since red blood cells are overproduced in the marrow, this leads to abnormally high numbers of circulating red blood cells (red blood mass) within the blood. Consequently, the blood thickens and increases in volume, a condition called hyperviscosity. Thickened blood may not flow through smaller blood vessels properly. A variety of symptoms can occur in individuals with polycythemia vera including nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, weakness, dizziness or itchy skin; an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly); a variety of gastrointestinal issues; and the risk of blood clot formation, which may prevent blood flow to vital organs. More than 90 percent of individuals with polycythemia vera have a mutation of the JAK2 gene. The exact role of this mutation in the development of polycythemia vera is not yet known.

Since red blood cells are overproduced in the marrow, this leads to abnormally high numbers of circulating red blood cells (red blood mass) within the blood. Consequently, the blood thickens and increases in volume, a condition called hyperviscosity. Thickened blood may not flow through smaller blood vessels properly. A variety of symptoms can occur in individuals with polycythemia vera including nonspecific symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, weakness, dizziness or itchy skin; an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly); a variety of gastrointestinal issues; and the risk of blood clot formation, which may prevent blood flow to vital organs.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been associated with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.

Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been associated with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been associated with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been associated with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to the how often symptoms occur, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.

Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been associated with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to the how often symptoms occur, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.

Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.

One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to the how often symptoms occur, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.

In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to the how often symptoms occur, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with proper control of asthma with step down therapy, prognosis is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.

Asthma is clinically classed according to the how often symptoms occur, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment of acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by inhaling corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and thus less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to therapy over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were affected worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally.

Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors.

In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.

Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been associated with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

These factors influence how severe asthma is and how well it responds to medication. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Studying the prevalence of asthma and related diseases such as eczema and hay fever have yielded important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of having asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of having asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is associated with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has focused on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a primary cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly reduces the risk of developing asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse fashion; exposure during the first year of life was found to reduce the risk of allergic sensitization and of developing asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this data has inspired research into other facets of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that appears to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the rise in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic rise in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Several factors associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma, including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been associated with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and individuals with immunologically mediated urticaria may also experience systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria, rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, anaphylaxis.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to how often symptoms happen, forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiration flow rate. Asthma may also be classed as atopic (external) or non-atopic (internal).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Asthma is clinically classed according to how often symptoms happen, forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiration flow rate. Asthma may also be classed as atopic (external) or non-atopic (internal).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been linked with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to how often symptoms happen, forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiration flow rate. Asthma may also be classed as atopic (external) or non-atopic (internal).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally.

These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.

In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Asthma may also be classed as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally.

These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to how often symptoms happen, forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiration flow rate. Asthma may also be classed as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally.

In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.

In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.

Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.

One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Asthma may also be classed as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma.

Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Asthma is clinically classed according to how often symptoms happen, forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiration flow rate. Asthma may also be classed as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to how often symptoms happen, forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiration flow rate. Asthma may also be classed as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma.

The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×.

In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.

Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.

One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Asthma may also be classed as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock.

Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been linked with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Asthma is clinically classed according to how often symptoms happen, forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1), and peak expiration flow rate. Asthma may also be classed as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic).   It is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treating acute symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist (such as salbutamol). Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by breathing in corticosteroids. Leukotriene antagonists are less effective than corticosteroids and therefore less preferred.  Its diagnosis is usually made based on the pattern of symptoms and/or response to treatment over time. The prevalence of asthma has increased significantly since the 1970s. As of 2010, 300 million people were impacted worldwide. In 2009 asthma caused 250,000 deaths globally. Despite this, with the right control of asthma with step down treatment, outcome is generally good.  Causes  Asthma is caused by environmental and genetic factors. These factors determine how serious asthma is and how well it responds to medicine. The interaction is complex and not fully understood.  Examining the prevalence of asthma and related conditions such as eczema and hay fever have given important clues about some key risk factors. The strongest risk factor for getting asthma is a history of atopic diseases; this increases one's risk of hay fever by up to 5× and the risk of asthma by 3–4×. In children between the ages of 3–14, a positive skin test for allergies and an increase in immunoglobulin E increases the chance of getting asthma. In adults, the more allergens one reacts positively to in a skin test, the higher the odds of getting asthma.  Because much allergic asthma is linked with sensitivity to indoor allergens and because Western styles of housing favor greater exposure to indoor allergens, much attention has centered on increased exposure to these allergens in infancy and early childhood as a main cause of the rise in asthma. Primary prevention studies aimed at the aggressive reduction of airborne allergens in a home with infants have shown mixed findings. Strict reduction of dust mite allergens, for example, cuts down the risk of allergic sensitization to dust mites, and modestly cuts down the risk of getting asthma up until the age of 8 years old. However, studies also showed that the effects of exposure to cat and dog allergens worked in the converse way; exposure during the first year of life was found to cut down the risk of allergic sensitization and of getting asthma later in life.  The inconsistency of this information has inspired research into other aspects of Western society and their impact upon the prevalence of asthma. One subject that seems to show a strong correlation is the development of asthma and obesity. In the United Kingdom and United States, the increase in asthma prevalence has echoed an almost epidemic increase in the prevalence of obesity. In Taiwan, symptoms of allergies and airway hyper-reactivity increased in correlation with each 20% increase in body-mass index. Many factors linked with obesity may play a part in the pathogenesis of asthma, including reduced respiratory function due to a buildup of adipose tissue (fat) and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state, which has been linked with non-eosinophilic asthma.  Asthma has been linked with Churg–Strauss syndrome, and someone with immunologically mediated urticaria (hives) may also have systemic symptoms with generalized urticaria (hives), rhino-conjunctivitis, orolaryngeal and gastrointestinal (stomach) symptoms, asthma, and, at worst, allergic shock. Additionally, adult-onset asthma has been linked with periocular xanthogranulomas.   "

Cirrhosis is usually caused by alcohol addiction, hepatitis B and C, and fatty liver disease, but has many other possible causes. Some cases are idiopathic (i.e., cause is not known).  Ascites (retaining fluid in the abdominal cavity) is the most common complication of cirrhosis, and is linked with a poor quality of life, increased risk of infection, and a poor long-term result. Other potentially life-threatening complications are hepatic encephalopathy (confusion and coma) and bleeding from esophageal varices. Cirrhosis is generally irreversible, and treatment usually focuses on preventing progression and complications. In advanced stages of cirrhosis the only choice is a liver transplant.  The word "cirrhosis" comes from Greek ?????? [kirrhós] meaning yellow, tawny (the orange-yellow color of the diseased liver) + Eng. med. suff. -osis. While the clinical entity was known before, it was René Laennec who gave it the name "cirrhosis" in his 1819 work in which he also describes the stethoscope.  Pathophysiology  The liver plays a critical role in forming proteins (e.g., albumin, clotting factors and complement), detoxifing and storing (e.g., vitamin A). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates.  Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is taken away at this stage, the changes are still fully reversible.  The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma, stoping the portal flow of blood through the organ and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the stellate cell, a cell type that usually stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma leads to activation of the stellate cell, which becomes contractile (called myofibroblast) and blocks blood flow in the circulation. In addition, it releases TGF-?1, which results in a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it releases TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.  The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate liver cell nodules, which eventually replace the whole liver architecture, leading to reduced blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal high blood pressure is responsible for most serious complications of cirrhosis.  Diagnosis  The gold standard for diagnosing cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data indicate cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but important risk to liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications due to liver biopsy. Ascites, low platelet count, and spider nevi are useful physical findings."

While the clinical entity was known before, it was René Laennec who gave it the name "cirrhosis" in his 1819 work in which he also describes the stethoscope.  Pathophysiology  The liver plays a critical role in forming proteins (e.g., albumin, clotting factors and complement), detoxifying and storing (e.g., vitamin A). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates.  Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is taken away at this stage, the changes are still fully reversible.  The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma, stopping the portal flow of blood through the organ and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the stellate cell, a cell type that usually stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma leads to activation of the stellate cell, which becomes contractile (called myofibroblast) and blocks blood flow in the circulation. In addition, it releases TGF-?1, which results in a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it secretes TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.  The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate liver cell nodules, which eventually replace the whole liver architecture, leading to reduced blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal high blood pressure is responsible for most serious complications of cirrhosis.  Diagnosis  The gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data indicate cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but important risk to liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications due to liver biopsy. Ascites, low platelet count, and spider nevi are useful physical findings."

This results in loss of liver function. Cirrhosis is usually caused by alcohol addiction, hepatitis B and C, and fatty liver disease, but has many other possible causes. Some cases are idiopathic (i.e., cause is not known).  Ascites (retaining fluid in the abdominal cavity) is the most common complication of cirrhosis, and is linked with a poor quality of life, increased risk of infection, and a poor long-term result. Other potentially life-threatening complications are hepatic encephalopathy (confusion and coma) and bleeding from esophageal varices. Cirrhosis is generally irreversible, and treatment usually focuses on preventing progression and complications. In advanced stages of cirrhosis the only choice is a liver transplant.  The word "cirrhosis" comes from Greek ?????? [kirrhós] meaning yellow, tawny (the orange-yellow color of the diseased liver) + Eng. med. suff. -osis. While the clinical entity was known before, it was René Laennec who gave it the name "cirrhosis" in his 1819 work in which he also describes the stethoscope.  Pathophysiology  The liver plays a critical role in forming proteins (e.g., albumin, clotting factors and complement), detoxifying and storing (e.g., vitamin A). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates.  Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is taken away at this stage, the changes are still fully reversible.  The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma, stopping the portal flow of blood through the organ and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the stellate cell, a cell type that usually stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma leads to activation of the stellate cell, which becomes contractile (called myofibroblast) and blocks blood flow in the circulation. In addition, it releases TGF-?1, which results in a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it secretes TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.  The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate liver cell nodules, which eventually replace the whole liver architecture, leading to reduced blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal high blood pressure is responsible for most serious complications of cirrhosis.  Diagnosis  The gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data indicate cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but important risk to liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications due to liver biopsy.

Damage to the hepatic parenchyma leads to activation of the stellate cell, which becomes contractile (called myofibroblast) and blocks blood flow in the circulation. In addition, it releases TGF-?1, which results in a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it secretes TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.  The fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate liver cell nodules, which eventually replace the whole liver architecture, leading to reduced blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, which leads to hypersplenism and increased sequestration of platelets. Portal high blood pressure is responsible for most serious complications of cirrhosis.  Diagnosis  The gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a percutaneous, transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data indicate cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but important risk to liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications due to liver biopsy.

The preliminary results, disclosed at the White House by Anthony S. Fauci, chief of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which led the placebo-controlled trial, found that the drug accelerated the recovery of hospitalized patients but had only a marginal benefit in the rate of death.  That falls short of the magic bullet or cure that many were hoping for in Gilead’s drug. But with no approved treatments for Covid-19, Fauci said, it will become the standard of care for hospitalized patients and serve as a key building block as clinicians hone their approach."
